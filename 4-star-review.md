# Pretty good restaurant

Me and my fiance ate there a couple of days ago. It was after work so we were quite tired already and wanted to have a nice meal. The location is nice, friendly staff and ok prices. My overall experience was good, just a little under great so I'm giving it 4 stars for now.
